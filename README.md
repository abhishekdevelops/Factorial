ðŸ”¢ Factorial Calculator â€“ JavaScript Logic Project
This is a beginner-friendly JavaScript project that calculates the factorial of a number using a simple for loop. The project demonstrates the use of core logic and control flow in JavaScript.

ðŸš€ How It Works
The function takes a number as input.

A result variable is initialized to 1.

A for loop runs from the number down to 1.

On each iteration, the current number is multiplied to result.

The final result is returned and logged in the browser console.
