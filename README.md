# ðŸ”¢ Factorial Calculator â€“ JavaScript Logic Project

This is a beginner-friendly JavaScript project that calculates the factorial of a number using a simple `for` loop. The project demonstrates the use of core logic and control flow in JavaScript.

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. The function takes a number as input.  
2. A result variable is initialized to 1.  
3. A `for` loop runs from the number down to 1.  
4. On each iteration, the current number is multiplied to `result`.  
5. The final result is returned and logged in the **browser console**.
